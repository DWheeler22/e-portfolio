    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm DJ Wheeler, a Cybersecurity major at Penn State. I was born in Fauquier County, 
      Virginia, but moved to the small town of Monroe, Connecticut where I was raised into 
      adulthood. From a very young age, I was fascinated by computers and technology, and my 
      family would often refer to me to solve technical problems. This early exposure steered
      me towards the Penn State College of Information Sciences and Technology. Since joining
      this college, I found a passion for cybersecurity, particularly in ethical hacking and network defense.
      I enjoy learning about operating systems, networking protocols, and vulnerability assessment tools.
    </p>

    <h3>Involvement</h3>
    <p>At Penn State, I am actively involved in the Competitive Cybersecurity Organization (CCSO), 
      where I am a practicing member of the Red Team. In this role, I practice offensive security 
      skills several times a week to practice for competitions. This includes completing offensive 
      security labs through platforms like TryHackMe and HackTheBox. I gain experience in a team 
      environment by collaborating with other team members to penetration test cybersecurity ranges. 
      I also use these skills during in house wargaming exercises to prepare the Blue Team for their
      competitions. Finally, I serve as a mentor to younger students in the club by assisting them in 
      completing introductory red team workshops and labs.
    </p>

    <h3>Future Goals</h3>
    <p>
      In the future, I aim to further develop my skills in ethical hacking and network defense, with the 
      goal of becoming a certified cybersecurity professional. I plan to pursue certifications such as 
      CompTIA Security+, CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker), OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional)
      to validate my expertise. Additionally, I hope to contribute to the cybersecurity community and 
      eventually work in a role that allows me to protect organizations from cyber threats.
